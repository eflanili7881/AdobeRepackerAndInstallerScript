# Adobe Repacker and Installer Script - (for CS5 - present)
A .bat/.sh script that compresses unpacked assets of Adobe products and installs them.

# CAUTION!
Please, don't use this script for piracy things. I wrote this script for who wants to store Adobe application installers with unpacked assets for various reasons. My reason was maximize deduplication ratings on my Windows Server Storage Spaces storage to store more programs. That's why I wrote this script. I will improve this script day by day.
