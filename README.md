# Adobe Repacker and Installer Script - HyperDrive (HD) for Macintosh (for CC 2015 - present)
A .bat script that compresses unpacked Adobe HyperDrive (HD) assets and installs them.

# CAUTION!
Please, don't use this script for piracy things. I wrote this script for who wants to store HyperDrive (HD)-based Adobe application installers with unpacked assets for various reasons. My reason was maximize deduplication ratings on my Windows Server Storage Spaces storage to store more programs. That's why I wrote this script. I will improve this script day by day.
