# CAUTION!
Please, don't use this branch's content for piracy things. I put this patched binaries for who wants to install their unpacked RIBS-based Adobe application installers for various reasons. My reason was maximize deduplication ratings on my Windows Server Storage Spaces storage to store more programs.
