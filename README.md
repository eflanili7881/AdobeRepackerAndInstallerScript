A repo that contains patched binaries for installing unpacked Adobe RIBS assets.

# CAUTION!
Please, don't use this branch's content for piracy things. I put this patched binaries for who wants to install their unpacked RIBS-based Adobe application installers for various reasons. My reason was maximize deduplication ratings on my Windows Server Storage Spaces storage to store more programs.

## Why I repeated above thing 3 times?
Because I'm afraid that Adobe can copy-strike me like on archive.org. I put these files for **LEGITIMATE** users.

## Credits
- Me for writing script.
- PainteR for patching specific 3 binaries for installing unpacked Adobe RIBS-based applications (veision 8.0.0.15 of RIBS to be precise).
- Adobe Systems Incorporated for providing original binaries.

## What's this repo contains?
This repo contains patched binaries for installing unpacked Adobe RIBS applications.

## Special note
- I compared all dll's with Cutter and I see what's the PainteR did. PainteR just bypassed verification mechanism. With manual patching, I able to patch 9.x.x.x engine (9.0.0.65 to be precise) and install SpeedGrade CC 2015 with modified assets in both folders without a problem.
